First Step (Bangladesh Perspective):
Collect/Generate localized data related to BPV usage in cities like Khulna or Jashore.
Since real data may be scarce, begin by:

Using OpenStreetMap (OSM) for road networks

Simulating BPV movement and charging scenarios in SUMO

Integrating weather and time patterns to create synthetic datasets for model input

🔧 Step-by-Step Thesis Workflow
🔹 Phase 1: Literature Review & Tool Setup (Month 1–3)
Study recent works on BPV load forecasting and smart grid applications

Identify modeling gaps relevant to Bangladesh

Set up tools: Python, SUMO, OSM, Jupyter, Google Colab, KNIME, OMNeT++

🔹 Phase 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing (Month 3–4)
Use OSM to extract city-level maps for SUMO

Simulate BPV traffic in SUMO using TraCI framework

Add synthetic data for:

Traffic flow

Charging station locations

Temperature/weather (using APIs or historical data)

Preprocess data using Pandas/KNIME

🔹 Phase 3: Baseline Model Development (Month 5–6)
Train baseline models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, MAPE

Tune hyperparameters

🔹 Phase 4: Advanced Modeling (Month 7–8)
Implement time-series models:

LSTM

Quantile LSTM (for uncertainty range)

Compare performance with baseline models

🔹 Phase 5: Scenario Simulation & Visualization (Month 9)
Simulate real-world conditions:

Rush hours vs. non-rush hours

Weekdays vs. weekends

Peak summer vs. winter loads

Use Streamlit for interactive visualization

Show heatmaps or line graphs of load forecasts

🔹 Phase 6: Report Writing & Result Analysis (Month 10–11)
Analyze model accuracy

Interpret results in context of Bangladesh’s power grid

Discuss limitations and future improvements

Draft the full thesis with figures/tables

🔹 Phase 7: Supervisor Review & Final Submission (Month 12)
Revise based on supervisor’s feedback

Finalize formatting, references, diagrams

Submit hard copy and soft copy
